## Dependencies
- numpy==1.11.3
- tensorflow-gpu==1.0.0
- keras==2.0.4
- matplotlib==2.0.0

## Hardware
We used a single desktop computer with:
- Intel i5-7400 processor
- Nvidia GeForce GTX 1060 3GB GPU
- 8GB DDR4 RAM
With our configuration, it took approximately 2 hours to run the `run_mnist_cnn.sh` script.

## Installation
TODO: Make this pip installable.

## Execution
Once the package has been installed, you may run the included `run_mnist_cnn.sh` script. 

This will run the forward thinking neural network (achieved 99.72% in our tests), the backpropagation equivalent of our model (achieved 99.63% in our tests), and saves and displays a plot comparing the test and train accuracies.
