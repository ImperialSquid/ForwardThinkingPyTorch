# Forward Thinking PyTorch Edition
This project's purpose is to take the code from tkchris93/ForwardThinking and restructure it in a few ways
- Transfer code over to PyTorch (the developer's preference)
- Clean up and reformat into OOP style code
- Reduce rigidity allowing for adaptable layer counts

Ultimately this is with the aim of making a Multitasking Learning Forward model (still to be implemented)

The old readme is still viewable in OLD_README.md
